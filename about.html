                <h2>About</h2>
                <P class="out">Dinesh is a quick study. Dinesh is from a middle class family. Finished his schooling in Santhome higher secondary school.
                    He come over the schools and colleges with no trouble, it is one of the things to get proud of. As you can see his interest to things in
                    this portfolio is not fullfilled, he has major of his interest in watching english series, movies(logical movies). Another thing which make him feel proud
                    is,the feedbacks of the movie and series which he suggested to people. Dinesh can quick understand the subject if he is interested.
                    Dinesh is an effortfull person. Dinesh is a good teacher too. Many people didn't understand the meaning of work. When we are hired in 
                    a company people will work in the mindset of earning money. That is necesary only but one should not fully indulged in term to work only
                    for money. They have to work to raise their skill, they must get goosebump that they are learning something new. This is my one of the policies.
                    Dinesh maybe looked like confused, not suitable blah blah blah. But the output of my work will decide that your assumption is wrong.
                    Dinesh was so strong in determination. A many people crossed their life with this words <i>"When you enter into the college you will know what is life.
                        "</i> actual reality is when you come out of the campus you'll know what is life.
